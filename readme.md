# Machine Learning Resources

## Welcoming Introductory Textbooks
 * [*Machine Learning* by Tom Mitchell, a very readable intro to ML book](https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Tom-M-Mitchell/dp/1259096955/)


## More Exhaustive Textbooks 
 * [*Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning*, Christopher Bishop---Probably not the textbook to try to chug through when you're new to the field (will have to survive 100-200 pages before getting to your first practical model and not hands-on, but perhaps the best second textbook, for someone who already knows enough to be dangerous but wants to develop a more rigorous understanding.]

## Basic Probability and Stats
 * [*Seeing Theory* (from Brown) visual/interactive tutorial on basic probability](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/basic-probability/index.html)

## Information Theory
 * [*A Mathematical Theory of Communication*, Claude Shannon---the foundational paper in the area, still reads crystal clear.](http://math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/others/shannon/entropy/entropy.pdf)

## Support Vector Machines
 * [Patrick Winston's lecture from MIT OpenCourseWare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PwhiWxHK8o)

## Probabilistic Graphical Models
 * [*Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems*, Judea Pearl's classic text on PGMs---(be careful, a lot has changed since 1988)](https://www.amazon.com/Probabilistic-Reasoning-Intelligent-Systems-Representation/dp/1558604790)
 * [Mathematical Monk's explanation of the forward-backward algorithm for HMMs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zDARfKVm7s)
 

## Deep Learning 
 
## Learning Theory
 * [*Understanding Machine Learning*, Shai Shalev-Schwartz and Shai Ben-David---great textbook introducing key ideas of PAC-learning, VC-dimension.](https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Machine-Learning-Theory-Algorithms/dp/1107057132)
