# Machine Learning Resources

## Welcoming Introductory Textbooks
 * [*Machine Learning*](https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Tom-M-Mitchell/dp/1259096955/), Tom Mitchell---a very readable intro to ML book. Surprisingly relevant today even after 20-30 years. Starts simple with discrete data, finite hypothesis classes, inductive bias, an intuitive exposure to no free lunch. Works through decision trees, neural networks (perhaps the most dates aspect), basic statistics, a high-level exposure to PAC-learning. Scores major points as an intro text for  broad scope, conversational tone, readability.

## More Exhaustive Textbooks 
 * [*Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning*](https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Recognition-Learning-Information-Statistics/dp/0387310738), Christopher Bishop---Probably not the textbook to try to chug through when you're new to the field (will have to survive 100-200 pages before getting to your first practical model and not hands-on, but perhaps the best second textbook, for someone who already knows enough to be dangerous but wants to develop a more rigorous understanding.
